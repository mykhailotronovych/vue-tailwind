# Vue Tailwind (https://vue-tailwind.com/)

VueTailwind is a set of HTML components ready for Vuejs where you can define your classes for each element, in this way you can give your own personality to your application and avoid all those default styles that comes with every framework.

Although this library works with any CSS library since you define the classes, VueTailwind works great together with [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com).

## How does it work?

Install this project and create your own template for the components; you can use the default template `src / themes / default.js` as a guide.

## Whats next?

The idea is to create a big set of common components using the same philosophy of configurable elements that could be adapted to your project style:

This are the priorities (subject to change).

**Basic inputs**
- [ ] Checkbox group
- [ ] File input

**Rich inputs**
- [ ] Rich Select (with tagging, autocomplete, remote data sets, etc.)
- [ ] Date/Time Picker
- [ ] Rich file input (drop, multiupload, progress bar, etc)

**Components**
- [ ] Modal
- [ ] Tooltip
- [ ] Dropdown
- [ ] Progress bar
