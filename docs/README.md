# Vue Tailwind

VueTailwind is a set of HTML components ready for Vuejs where you can define your classes for each element, in this way you can give your personality to your application.

Although this library works with any CSS library since you define the classes, VueTailwind works great together with [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com)

##Â How does it work?

Install this project and create your own template for the components; you can use the default template `src / themes / default.js` as a guide.
